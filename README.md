As a data scientist, I've been tasked with trying to analyze a school district
filled with multiple schools.  I have been given data on the scores in math and 
reading for each student.  

First, I find the overall pass rate and pass score across all schools, along with
the total number of schools and students.  Later on, I group them based on high school
attended.  There we can compare how well each High School compares to each other in terms
of passing rates.  

Next, I grouped based on grade, then per student budget and then finally school type to 
see if there were any noticeable trends in the passing score.
